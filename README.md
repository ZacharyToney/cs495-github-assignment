Ben Lawson - Over the summer, I worked at Salesforce in downtown Indianapolis. I biked everyday to work and did 3 escape rooms with my friends. I explored all around Indianapolis including the bike paths, bars, and ate a lot of food.
Vanessa Covarrubias - Over the summer,  I hung out friends, went to the parks, hiked a bit. Went to some resteraunts. It was fun and learned a lot.
